#Description
This project focuses on calculating and visualizing the volatility of a financial asset. We use the yfinance library to obtain the historical data of the asset, pandas to calculate the True Range and the Average True Range, and matplotlib to plot the results.

#Additional Resources
If you want to learn more about the concept of volatility, the ATR indicator and the code in detail, I invite you to read my article on [Python for Finance](https://pythonforfinance.substack.com/). In this article, I explain step by step how to perform this analysis.

In addition, you can [subscribe to my newsletter](https://pythonforfinance.substack.com/) to receive more content on how to use Python to analyze and operate in the financial markets.

I hope you find this project useful and interesting! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue.
